2025-04-03 01:47:41 - Initial creation and Redux migration decision

## State Management Migration to Redux Toolkit

### Decision
Migrate from document.dispatchEvent-based state management to Redux Toolkit

### Rationale
* Improved state management with centralized store
* Better debugging capabilities with Redux DevTools
* More maintainable and scalable architecture
* Elimination of DOM-based event system for state updates
* Type-safe state management with Redux Toolkit's built-in TypeScript support
* Simplified testing with predictable state changes

### Implementation Details
* Use Redux Toolkit's createSlice for feature-based state management
* Replace document.dispatchEvent with Redux actions
* Implement proper TypeScript types for state and actions
* Use React-Redux hooks (useSelector, useDispatch) in components
* Consider performance implications and implement memoization where needed

## Future Decisions
*(To be added as architectural decisions are made)*

## Redux Slice Structure (2025-04-03 01:51:37)

### Decision
Create two separate slices for search and selection functionality:
1. `searchSlice` for search query, category selection, and recent emojis
2. `selectionSlice` for selected emojis and grid focus management

### Rationale
* Separation of Concerns: Search and selection are distinct features
* Performance: Updates to search won't trigger re-renders of selection state
* Local Storage: Selection state persistence handled by middleware
* Type Safety: Strong typing for both state trees

### Implementation Details
* Search state includes query, category, and recent emojis
* Selection state includes selected emojis and focused grid index
* Local storage middleware for persisting selections
* Typed actions and state for better development experience
* Direct replacement for current document.dispatchEvent usage
*Updates will be logged with timestamps*
