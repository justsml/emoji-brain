# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

## Current Focus

* Refining and testing the Pagefind search integration.
* Ensuring smooth user experience with the new search functionality.

## Recent Changes (as of 2025-04-07)

* **Pagefind Integration:** Replaced/augmented previous search with Pagefind. Added build process and updated frontend.
* **Search Enhancements:** Improved search options, sorting, and metadata handling.
* **Refactoring:** Simplified Emoji Explorer layout/accessibility, cleaned up Playwright config.
* **Dependency Updates:** Updated Pagefind library versions.
* *Previous focus was on Redux integration (see progress.md for status review).*

## Open Questions/Issues

* How robust is the Pagefind indexing for all emoji metadata?
* Are there any edge cases in the new search UI/UX?
* What is the final status of the planned Redux refactoring? Is it still needed or completed?

## Next Actions

1. Conduct thorough testing of the Pagefind search feature.
2. Review the necessity and status of the previously planned Redux migration.
3. Update `systemPatterns.md` with details on the Pagefind integration. (This task will do that)
